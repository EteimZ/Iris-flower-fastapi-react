# ML-React-App

This is a template on which we can build Machine learning apps with React as the frontend and FastApi on the backend to make predictions.

It is based on this [repo](https://github.com/kb22/ML-React-App-Template/tree/master/ui) by [kb22](https://github.com/kb22). The template makes use of the iris dataset to make predictions.
